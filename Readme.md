# hynkle's vim settings

## installation instructions

`\curl -fsSkL http://raw.github.com/hynkle/.vim/master/install.sh | bash`

(Of course if you're halfway prudent, you'll take a look at install.sh first.)


## to add a plugin

Add a `Plug` statement in the .vimrc, then run :PlugInstall from inside vim.
See the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) project for more details.
